#### Pages 2-3: Toby's Lonely Stray Life 
 
(Left Page 2)

> Toby sat watching the sidewalk parade,  
Where happy dogs trotted in sunlit shade.  
"Cheezy! Finley!" he called with a whine,  
"Why don't I have a human... and walks that are mine?" 

🐾 Interactive Prompt:  
"Point to the happy dogs on this page—let your pup sniff their furry friends!"  

(Right Page 3)

> That night in his box 'neath the laundromat light,  
Toby dreamed of life with a human, just right:  
Long walks on a leash, where he led the way,    
Belly rubs, snuggles, and treats every day!

🐾 Interactive Prompt:  
"Ask your dog: ‘What do YOU dream about?’ (Bonus: Scratch their belly on ‘treats every day!’)"


#### Pages 4-5: Inciting Incident

(Left 4)

> Toby awoke to a flap-flap sound,  
As Cheezy Crow landed on a dumpster mound:    
"Hey, pup! I've flown over bridge and street -  
There's a shelter across the toll bridge, where dogs and humans meet!"

🐾 Interactive Prompt:  
"Ask your dog: ‘What do YOU dream about?’ (Bonus: Scratch their belly on ‘treats every day!’)"

Note- 'flap flap flap' on image

(Right 5)

> From his stash of treasures (a toy car, two rings),  
Cheezy dropped a coin that went cling-a-ling!  
"This doggy token pays the bridge-crossing toll,  
But hurry—your new human awaits! Let’s roll!"

🐾 Interactive Prompt:  
"Jingle your keys or a coin like Cheezy—does your pup tilt their head?"

Visual Cues for Interaction:  
Add a "Sniff Here!" arrow pointing to a Cheez-It crumb on Page 5.

#### Pages 6-7: Postman

(Left 6)

> Rounding the block, who should appear?  
His favorite mail carrier—“Hey Tobes, over here!”  
With jingling keys and treats to share,  
He never forgets this street dog's prayer!

🐾 Interactive Prompt:  
"Pretend to toss a treat like the mailman—watch your dog’s eyes follow!"

(Right 7)

> “Special delivery!” the mail carrier announced,  
Tossing the biscuit on which Toby pounced,   
Finley sniffed, “relax man, don't have a cow!”  
But Toby just danced— and then took a bow!

🐾 Interactive Prompt:  
"Say ‘Take a bow!’ and see if your dog dips their head or paws at you!"

#### Pages 8-9: Chicken Man - scent detour

(Left 8)

> SNIFF-SNIFF-SNIFF! "Chicken! This way!"  
Again Toby dragged them all astray.  
Cheesy crowed, "At this rate, we'll never get there!"  
As Toby ran towards the chicken man's chair.

🐾 Interactive Prompt:  
"Say ‘SNIFF-SNIFF!’ dramatically—does your dog sniff the book or air?"

(Right 9)

> The Chicken Man tossed Toby a treat,  
"For my favorite street dog – take a seat and eat!"  
Finley meowed, "MORE BLOCKS TO GO and it's getting dark!"  
"Let's save some time and cut through the park!"

🐾 Interactive Prompt:  
"Make loud chewing sounds (‘CHOMP-CHOMP’)—does your dog lick their lips?"

Note- chomp chomp gulp on image

#### Pages 10-11: Stormy Park Fireworks

(Left 10)

> KABLAM-KABOOM-KAPOP! The sky lit up bright.    
Toby tucked his tail and shook in fright.   
His tongue was panting, his ears went flat—  
Now he’s wearing a bush as a scaredy-cap! 

🐾 Interactive Prompt:  
"Whisper ‘It’s okay…’ and gently hold your dog’s paw during this page." 

(Right 11)

> The night grew quiet, the booms all fled,  
But Toby still hid his bush-hat head.  
Cheezy murmured, "Look! We're all safe and sound—  
We'll nest here tonight 'til the sun comes around.

🐾 Interactive Prompt:  
"Ask your dog: ‘Are YOU brave like Toby?’ (Reward with a treat for tail wags!)" 

#### Pages 12-13: Toll Bridge Rescue

(Left 12)

>Rascal the raccoon crossed his arms with a growl,  
"Dogs can’t cross! Scram, pup— don’t scowl!"  
Toby dropped his doggy coin with a clink and a hope,  
But Rascal just smirked. “Hmm…dog, the answers still nope.”

(Right 13)

> Cheezy gasped, “His paw’s stuck tight—  
That jar’s got Rascal in a plight!”  
Toby nudged it—POP!—the jar flew free,  
“FINE,” Rascal sighed. “proceed, all three”

> Cheezy gasped, “His paw’s stuck tight—    
That jar’s had him trapped all night!”    
Toby nudged it—POP!—it flew,    
Rascal groaned, “FINE Cross- ALL THREE OF YOU.”


#### Pages 14-15: Shelter Arrival

(Left 14)

> The shelter door stood cracked ahead,  
"Paws & Hearts" in gold letters read.  
Toby's tail drooped. "Wait—let's go BACK—  
What if the humans are mean? Or loud? Or whack?"  

(Right 15)

> Finley blocked his retreat. "Oh please—  
You've faced fireworks! This makes you freeze?"  
Cheezy dropped his fry. "Times running out mate."  
Toby breathed deep... and went to meet his fate.  

#### Pages 16-17: Shelter Arrival

(Left 16)

> "SIT! SPEAK! ROLLOVER!" the bratty kid roared,  
Gaming controller clutched, snack-stained and bored.  
He yanked Toby's tail, spun him around.  
"Do what I say NOW, you lousy hound!"    

(Right 17)

> Toby yelped, his lip starting to quiver,  
"Bossy, cold, and mean - these always make me shiver!"   
With warning growl and leer, off he went  
To find his dreamt of human, one not so bent. 

#### Pages 18-19: Shelter Arrival

(Left 18)

> Next came a woman glued to her phone,  
Yap yappity yap, like she was alone.  
"Just need a mutt for my Socialgram posts,  
Cute pictures in sweaters get lots of votes"  

(Right 19)

> Toby sniffed. "No walks? No throws?  
Just ‘pawsome’ posts in frilly bows?"  
One long grrrr—his verdict clear...  
"NEXT! This one’s all mirror, no ear."  

#### Pages 20-21: The Girl Who Knew His Name

(Left 20)
> Then - a whisper soft and true:      
"I'd name him Toby...if I could choose."      
Do all the things he dreamed we’d do!      
Long walks and belly rubs, to name just two.  
OR-Long walks and belly rubs, to name a few. 

🐾 Interactive Prompt:  
"Whisper your dog’s name like the girl does—watch their reaction!"   

(Right 21)
> Toby's ears shot up, his heart leapt high!      
This he searched for far and wide!    
He put his paw on his new friend's knee,    
You’re my human. Now… belly rubs, please?

🐾 Interactive Prompt:
" give belly rubs—just like Toby!"

Visual Cues for Interaction:  
Show Toby’s paw print where kids/dogs can high-five the book.
 

#### Pages 22-23: New Beginning

(Left 22)

> Leash clipped on - not tight, just right,  
Walking through his new city's light.  
Rounding the block, who should appear?      
A NEW mail carrier—“Hey dog, over here!”

(Right 23)

> Toby knew he'd miss his old street,  
The wild adventures, scraps to eat.  
But as his human whispered, "Goodnight, my friend,"  
He new he found his perfect story's end.
