#### Pages 2-3: Toby's Lonely Stray Life 
 
(Left Page 2)

> Toby sat watching the sidewalk parade,  
Where happy dogs trotted in sunlit shade.  
"Cheezy! Finley!" he called with a whine,  
"Why don't I get a human... and walks that are mine?"   

(Right Page 3)

> That night in his box 'neath the laundromat light,  
Toby dreamed of life with a human, just right:  
Long walks on a leash, where he led the way,    
Belly rubs, snuggles, and treats every day!


#### Pages 4-5: Inciting Incident

(Left 4)

> Toby woke up to a flap-flap sound,  
As Cheezy Crow landed on a dumpster mound:    
"Hey, pup! I've flown over bridge and street -  
There's a shelter past the toll bridge, where dogs and humans meet!"

(Right 5)

> From his stash of treasures (a toy car, two rings),  
Cheezy dropped a coin that went cling-a-ling!  
"This doggy token pays the bridge-crossing toll,  
But hurry—your new human awaits! Let’s roll!"

#### Pages 6-7: Postman

(Left 6)

> Rounding the block, who should appear?  
Toby’s favorite mail carrier—“Hey dog, over here!”  
With jingling keys and treats to share,  
He never forgets this scruffy mutt's prayer!

(Right 7)

> “Special delivery!” the mail carrier announced,  
Tossing the biscuit on which Toby pounced,   
Finley sniffed, “relax man, don't have a cow!”  
But Toby just danced— and then took a bow!

#### Pages 8-9: Chicken Man - scent detour

(Left 8)

> SNIFF-SNIFF-SNIFF! "Chicken! This way!"  
Again Toby dragged them all astray.  
Cheesy crowed, "At this rate, we'll never get there!"  
As Toby ran towards the chicken man's chair.

(Right 9)

> The Chicken Man tossed little Toby a treat,  
"For my favorite street dog – take a seat and eat!"  
Finley meowed, "MORE BLOCKS TO GO and it's getting dark!"  
Toby CHOMPED-CHOMPED-GULPED – "Let's save some time and cut through the park!"

#### Pages 10-11: Stormy Park Fireworks

(Left 10)

> KABLAM-KABOOM-KAPOP! The sky lit up bright.    
Toby tucked his tail and shook in fright.   
His tongue was panting, his ears went flat—  
Now he’s wearing a bush as a scaredy-cap!  

(Right 11)

> The night grew quiet, the booms all fled,  
But Toby still hid his bush-hat head.  
Cheezy murmured, "Look! We're all safe and sound—  
We'll sleep here tonight 'til the sun comes around. 

#### Pages 12-13: Toll Bridge Rescue

(Left 12)

>Rascal the raccoon crossed his arms with a growl,  
"Dogs can’t cross! Scram, pup— don’t scowl!"  
Toby dropped his doggy coin with a clink and a hope,  
But Rascal just smirked. “Hmm…dog, the answers still nope.”

(Right 13)

> Cheezy gasped, “His paw’s stuck tight—  
That jar’s got Rascal in a plight!”  
Toby nudged it—POP!—the jar flew free,  
“FINE,” Rascal sighed. “proceed, all three”

> Cheezy gasped, “His paw’s stuck tight—    
That jar’s had him trapped all night!”    
Toby nudged it—POP!—it flew,    
Rascal groaned, “FINE Cross- ALL THREE OF YOU.”


#### Pages 14-15: Shelter Arrival

(Left 14)

> The shelter door stood cracked ahead,  
"Paws & Hearts" in gold letters read.  
Toby's tail drooped. "Wait—let's go BACK—  
What if the humans are mean? Or loud? Or whack?"  

(Right 15)

> Finley blocked his retreat. "Oh please—  
You've faced fireworks! This makes you freeze?"  
Cheezy dropped his fry. "Times running out mate."  
Toby breathed deep... and went to meet his fate.  

#### Pages 16-17: Shelter Arrival

(Left 16)

> "SIT! SPEAK! ROLLOVER!" the bratty kid roared,  
Gaming controller clutched, snack-stained and bored.  
He yanked Toby's tail, spun him around.  
"Do what I say NOW, you lousy hound!"    

(Right 17)

> Toby yelped, his lip started to quiver,  
"Bossy, cold, and mean - these always make me shiver!"  
One warning growl with leer, then off he went, -or-  
With warning growls and leers, off he went  
To find his dreamt of human, one not so bent. 

#### Pages 18-19: Shelter Arrival

(Left 18)

> Next came a woman glued to her phone,  
Yap yappity yap, like she was alone.  
"Just need a mutt for my Socialgram posts,  
Cute pictures in sweaters get lots of votes"  

(Right 19)

> Toby gave her the side eye- here's your pose. vote on this  
She wants likes, not walks or belly-ache."  

He turned his tail (no fuss, no bark)...   
Next human, please—this one’s broke 


#### Pages 20-21: The Girl Who Knew His Name

(Left 20)
> Then - a whisper soft and true:    
"I'd name you Toby...if I could choose."    
Do all the things you dreamed we’d do!    
Long walks and belly rubs, to name just two    

(Right 21)
> Toby's ears perked up, his heart leapt high!    
She knows my name,    
 I finally found my human just Right  
 
 


*No coin, no bribe—just *trust so rare,
*He *pressed *his *muzzle *to her care.
*"You *dreamed *my *dreams?" *Her *nod so true...
*Toby sighed, *"Then *I pick YOU."

#### Pages 22-23: New Beginning

(Left 22)

show postman, walk, and friends.

revert back to "Why don't I get a dog... and walks that are mine?"  
Car rides and belly rubs, and tricks for cheese on last scene

Leash clipped on - not tight, just right,
Walking home through city light.
Finley waved from a fire escape,
Cheezy stole snacks - his usual shape.

(Right 23)

Toby knew he'd miss the street,
The wild adventures, scraps to eat.
But as his human whispered, "Goodnight, **new** friend,"
He found his perfect story's end.

Illustration:
- Girl walking Toby past city sights
- Finley and Cheezy waving goodbye

Interactive Prompt:  
"Give your pup a goodnight kissd!"
