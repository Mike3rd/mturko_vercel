#### Pages 2-3: Toby's Lonely Stray Life 
 
(Left Page 2)

> Toby sat watching the sidewalk parade,  
Where happy dogs trotted in sunlit shade.  
"Cheezy! Finley!" he called with a whine,  
"Why don't I get a human... and walks that are mine?"   

(Right Page 3)

> That night in his box 'neath the laundromat light,  
Toby dreamed of life with a human, just right:  
Long walks where he led the way,  
Belly rubs, and treats every day!


#### Pages 4-5: Inciting Incident

(Left 4)

> Toby woke with a flap-flap sound,  
As Cheezy Crow landed on a dumpster mound:    
"Hey, pup! I've flown over bridge and street -  
There's a shelter past the toll bridge, where dogs and humans meet!"

(Right 5)

> From his stash of treasures (a toy car, two rings),
Cheezy dropped a coin that went cling-a-ling!
"This doggy token pays the bridge-crossing toll,
But hurry—your new human awaits! Let’s roll!"

#### Pages 6-7: Postman

(Left 6)

> Rounding the block, who should appear?  
Toby’s favorite postman—“Over here!”  
With jingling keys and treats to share,  
*He never forgot this scruffy Toby bear!* need to fix bear?

(Right 7)

> “Special delivery!” the mailman announced,  
Tossing the biscuit on which Toby pounced,   
Finley sniffed, “relax, don't have a cow!”  
But Toby just danced— and then took a bow!

#### Pages 8-9: Chicken Man - scent detour

(Left 8)

> SNIFF-SNIFF-SNIFF! "Chicken! This way!"  
Toby dragged them all astray.  
Cheesy crowed, "At this rate, we'll never get there!"  
As Toby ran towards the chicken man's chair.

(Right 9)

> The Chicken Man tossed Toby a treat,  
"For my favorite street dog – take a seat and eat!"  
Finley meowed, "We’ve got BLOCKS TO GO, it's getting dark!"  
Toby CHOMPED-CHOMPED-GULPED – "Let's cut through the park!"

#### Pages 10-11: Stormy Park Fireworks

(Left 10)

> KABLAM-KABOOM-KAPOP! The sky lit up bright.    
Toby tucked his tail and shook in fright.   
His tongue was panting, his ears went flat—  
Now he’s wearing that bush as a scaredy-cap!  

(Right 11)

> The night grew quiet, the booms all fled,  
But Toby still hid his bush-hat head.  
Cheezy murmured, "We're all safe and sound—  
We'll sleep here tonight 'til the sun comes around. 

#### Pages 12-13: Toll Bridge Rescue

(Left 12)

>Rascal the raccoon crossed his arms with a growl,
"Dogs can’t cross! Scram, pup— don’t scowl!"
Toby dropped the doggy coin with a clink,
But Rascal just sneered. "Nice try pup... NOT!"

(Right 13)

Cheezy swooped down with a Cheez-It bright,
"A crunchy toll for passage, right?"
Rascal licked his lips... then frowned. "STILL no!"
Until—POP!—Toby freed his paw from the jar.
"FINE," Rascal mumbled. "But JUST you. No strays from afar."

Interactive Prompt: 
"Count the bribes: 1 coin, 1 snack, 1 rescue!"

#### Pages 14-15: Shelter Arrival

(Left 14)

"Paws & Hearts Rescue" the sign shone clear,
Families inside bringing cheer.
Toby trembled by the door,
"Will someone choose this street-smart mutt?"

(Right 15)

Finley purred, "Walk in like you're KING!"
Cheezy cawed, "Make those tail feathers sing!"
Toby breathed deep, then pushed inside,
Where futures were made and dreams took ride.

- Toby hesitating at door

Interactive Prompt:  
"Whisper encouragement to your pup!"

#### Pages 16-17: Bratty Kid Rejection
(Left 16)

First came a child with sticky hands,
"Ew, this one's DIRTY!" he demands.
Poking Toby's nose with grimy cheer,
"Do a TRICK!" The tone was clear.

(Right 17)

Toby sneezed on his shoes - ACHOO!
"GROSS!" The kid turned blue.
Finley smirked, "That's one way to say,
'Not your human - walk away!'"

Illustration:
- Bratty kid making disgusted face
- Toby fake-sneezing dramatically

Interactive Prompt:  
"Would your pup like this kid? Boo!"

#### Pages 18-19: Phone Lady Ignoring

(Left 18)

Next came a woman glued to her screen,
Scrolling where no dog had been.
"Just need one for my #DogLife posts,
Maybe in a sweater with matching toast?"

(Right 19)

Toby dropped his ball at her feet,
"Oops! My latte!" came her bleat.
He sighed and turned - this wasn't right,
A human should SEE their pup's delight.

Illustration:
- Woman taking selfie, ignoring Toby
- Spilled coffee cup, ball rolling away

Interactive Prompt:  
"Put down your phone and pet your pup!"

#### Pages 20-21: The Girl Who Knew His Name

(Left 20)

Then - a whisper soft and true:
"I'd name him Toby...if I could choose."
Toby's ears shot up, his heart went BOOM,
Someone knew his name in that room!

(Right 21)

He nudged her leg, tail THUMP-THUMP-THUD,
Dropped his ball in a puddle of mud.
She knelt down, tears in her eyes,
"You...you picked ME?" Toby sighed, "Wise."

Illustration:
- Shy girl crouching to Toby's level
- Muddy ball between them

Interactive Prompt:  
"Ask your pup: 'Would you choose me too?'"

#### Pages 22-23: New Beginning

(Left 22)

Leash clipped on - not tight, just right,
Walking home through city light.
Finley waved from a fire escape,
Cheezy stole snacks - his usual shape.

(Right 23)

Toby knew he'd miss the street,
The wild adventures, scraps to eat.
But as his girl whispered, "Goodnight, **new** friend,"
He found his perfect story's end.

Illustration:
- Girl walking Toby past city sights
- Finley and Cheezy waving goodbye

Interactive Prompt:  
"Give your pup a goodnight kissd!"
