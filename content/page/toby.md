Toby dreamed of life with a human, just right:  
Long walks where he led the way,  
Belly rubs, and treats every day!

#### Pages 4-5: Inciting Incident

(Left 4)

> Toby woke with a flap-flap sound,  
As Cheezy Crow cawed from the dumpster mound:  
"Hey, pup! I've flown over bridge and street -  
There's a shelter past the toll bridge, where dogs and humans meet!"

Setting: Same laundromat alley as Page 3  
- Toby stretching out of cardboard box (labeled "Fresh Laundry")

Action:

- Cheezy's wings scattering loose papers

(Right 5)

> From his stash of treasures (a toy car, two rings),
Cheezy dropped a coin that went cling-a-ling!
"This doggy token pays the bridge-crossing toll,
But hurry—your new human awaits! Let’s roll!"

Illustration:
- Toby already mid-dash, kicking up dust!
- Close-up of Cheezy's "stash" in a cracked flowerpot:

Toby’s favorite postman—“Over here!”  
With jingling keys and treats to share,  
He never forgot this scruffy Toby bear!

(Right 7)

> “Special delivery!” the mailman announced,  
Tossing the biscuit on which Toby pounced,   
Finley sniffed, “Relax, don't have a cow!”  
But Toby just danced— and then took a bow!

#### Pages 8-9: Postman's Treat


(Left 8)

> SNIFF-SNIFF-SNIFF! "Chicken! This way!"  
Toby dragged them all astray.  
Cheesy crowed, "At this rate, we'll never get there!"  
As Toby ran towards the chicken man's chair.

(Right 9)


> The Chicken Man tossed Toby a treat,  
"For my favorite street dog – take a seat and eat!"  
Finley meowed, "We’ve got BLOCKS TO GO, it's getting dark!"  
Toby CHOMPED-CHOMPED-GULPED – " Let's cut through the park!"

Fireworks bloomed like flowers of fright,  
He dove for the bushes— out of sight!

- Toby’s paws and tail visible under bush.

(Right 11)

> Cheezy cawed, "It's just a light-show, no harm to pets!
See? Not one firework’s bitten folks yet!"
Finley yanked his scruff: "Listen pup,
We’ll sleep here ‘til the sun comes up!"

#### Pages 12-13: Toll Bridge Rescue

(Left 12)

>Rascal the grumpy raccoon crossed his arms with a growl,
"Dogs can’t cross! Scram, pup— don’t scowl!"
Toby dropped the doggy coin with a clink,
But Rascal just sneered. "Nice try... NOT!"

(Right 13)

Cheezy swooped down with a Cheez-It bright,
"A crunchy toll for passage, right?"
Rascal licked his lips... then frowned. "STILL no!"
Until—POP!—Toby freed his paw from the jar.
"FINE," Rascal mumbled. "But JUST you. No strays from afar."

Illustration:

- Toby nudging it off with nose

Interactive Prompt:

(Left 14)

"Paws & Hearts Rescue" the sign shone clear,
Families inside bringing cheer.
Toby trembled by the door,
"Will someone choose this street-smart mutt?"

(Right 15)

Finley purred, "Walk in like you're KING!"
Cheezy cawed, "Make those tail feathers sing!"
Toby breathed deep, then pushed inside,
Where futures were made and dreams took ride.

#### Pages 16-17: Bratty Kid Rejection
(Left 16)

First came a child with sticky hands,
"Ew, this one's DIRTY!" he demands.
Poking Toby's nose with grimy cheer,
"Do a TRICK!" The tone was clear.

(Right 17)

Toby sneezed on his shoes - ACHOO!
"GROSS!" The kid turned blue.
Finley smirked, "That's one way to say,
'Not your human - walk away!'"

#### Pages 18-19: Phone Lady Ignoring

(Left 18)

Next came a woman glued to her screen,
Scrolling where no dog had been.
"Just need one for my #DogLife posts,
Maybe in a sweater with matching toast?"

(Right 19)

Toby dropped his ball at her feet,
"Oops! My latte!" came her bleat.
He sighed and turned - this wasn't right,
A human should SEE their pup's delight.

- Spilled coffee cup, ball rolling away

#### Pages 20-21: The Girl Who Knew His Name

(Left 20)

Then - a whisper soft and true:
"I'd name him Toby...if I could choose."
Toby's ears shot up, his heart went BOOM,
Someone knew his name in that room!

(Right 21)

He nudged her leg, tail THUMP-THUMP-THUD,
Dropped his ball in a puddle of mud.
She knelt down, tears in her eyes,
"You...you picked ME?" Toby sighed, "Wise."

- Muddy ball between them

Interactive Prompt:

#### Pages 22-23: New Beginning

(Left 22)

Leash clipped on - not tight, just right,
Walking home through city light.
Finley waved from a fire escape,
Cheezy stole snacks - his usual shape.

(Right 23)

Toby knew he'd miss the street,
The wild adventures, scraps to eat.
But as his girl whispered, "Goodnight, **new** friend,"
He found his perfect story's end.

- Finley and Cheezy waving goodbye

Interactive Prompt:
