Where happy dogs trotted in sunlit shade.

"Why don't I get a human... and walks that are mine?"

Toby dreamed of a life just right:  
Long walks where he led the way,  
Belly rubs, and treats every day!

#### Pages 4-5: Inciting Incident

(Left 4)

> Toby woke with a thump-thump sound,  
As Cheezy Crow cawed from the dumpster mound:  
"Up, pup! I've flown past bridge and street -  
There's a shelter past the toll where humans and dogs meet!"

Setting: Same laundromat alley as Page 3  
- Toby stretching out of cardboard box (labeled "Fresh Laundry")  
- Cheezy perched on a rusty dumpster (not a cart)  
- Morning light glinting off broken glass/puddles

Action:
- Toby's tail wagging so hard it knocks over a tin can
- Cheezy's wings scattering loose papers

(Right 5)

> From his stash of treasures (a toy car, two rings),  
Cheezy dropped a coin that went cling-a-ling!  
"This doggy token's your bridge-crossing key,  
But hurry - the raccoon takes bribes at three!"

Illustration:
Close-up of Cheezy's "stash" in a cracked flowerpot:
- Shiny junk (bottle caps, keys, doggy coin)

- Toby's paw reaching for the coin, eyes wide
- Finley peeking into frame with skeptical look
- Cheezy's stash now spills from dumpster edge (not flowerpot)

#### Pages 6-7: The Scent Detour

(Left 6)

> SNIFF-SNIFF-SNIFF! "Chicken! This way!"  
Toby dragged them all astray.  
Finley groaned, "We'll never get there!"  
As Toby ran towards the chicken man's chair.

(Right 7)

> The Chicken Man flipped a crispy bite,  
"For brave pups who don’t bark or bite!"  
Finley yowled, "This detour’s RUDE!"  
But Toby CRUNCHED in a gratuitous mood.

or

> The Chicken Man tossed a drumstick treat,  
"For street dogs – take a seat and eat!"  
Finley groaned, "We’ve got MILES TO GO!"  
But Toby CHOMP-CHOMP-GULPED – "...Yum. Too Slow?"

Illustration:
- Chicken Man winking, wearing a "BEST BIRD COOK" hat

Bonus Idea:
- Add a speech bubble from Toby:
  - "Worth it!" with chicken grease on his muzzle.

#### Pages 8-9: Postman's Treat

(Left 8)

Rounding the block, who should appear?
Toby's favorite postman - "Over here!"
With jingling keys and treats in pocket,
He never forgot this scruffy rocket.

(Right 9)

"Special delivery!" the mailman cheered,
Tossing a biscuit Toby revered.
Finley rolled her eyes, "So basic, so tame,"
But Toby just wagged - mail carriers were his game!

- Mailbag with shelter flyer visible

Interactive Prompt:  
"High-five your pup for good manners!"

#### Pages 10-11: Stormy Park Fireworks

(Left 10)

CRACKLE-POP! BOOM! The sky exploded,
Toby froze - his courage eroded.
Colors flashed bright, the noise so scary,
He ducked beneath a bush so hairy.

(Right 11)

Cheezy sang, "Just sky-confetti!
The world's shouting 'GO, Toby, READY?'"
Finley dragged a blanket near,
"Walk tall, doggo - home is here."

- Toby trembling under picnic blanket

"If your pup's scared of noises, hug them tight!"

#### Pages 12-13: Toll Bridge Rescue

(Left 12)

Rascal the raccoon crossed his arms with a growl,
"Dogs can’t cross! Scram, pup—don’t howl!"
Toby dropped the doggy coin with a clink,
But Rascal just sneered. "Nice try. I think NOT."

(Right 13)

Cheezy swooped down with a Cheez-It bright,
"A crunchy toll for passage, right?"
Rascal licked his lips... then frowned. "STILL no!"
Until—POP!—Toby freed his paw from the jar.
"FINE," Rascal mumbled. "But JUST you. No strays from afar."

Illustration:
- Rascal with jar-lid stuck on paw
- Toby nudging it off with nose

Interactive Prompt: 
"Count the bribes: 1 coin, 1 snack, 1 rescue!"

#### Pages 14-15: Shelter Arrival

(Left 14)

"Paws & Hearts Rescue" the sign shone clear,
Families inside bringing cheer.
Toby trembled by the door,
"Will someone choose this street-smart mutt?"

(Right 15)

Finley purred, "Walk in like you're KING!"
Cheezy cawed, "Make those tail feathers sing!"
Toby breathed deep, then pushed inside,
Where futures were made and dreams took ride.

"Whisper encouragement to your pup!"

#### Pages 16-17: Bratty Kid Rejection
(Left 16)

First came a child with sticky hands,
"Ew, this one's DIRTY!" he demands.
Poking Toby's nose with grimy cheer,
"Do a TRICK!" The tone was clear.

(Right 17)

Toby sneezed on his shoes - ACHOO!
"GROSS!" The kid turned blue.
Finley smirked, "That's one way to say,
'Not your human - walk away!'"

Illustration:
- Bratty kid making disgusted face
- Toby fake-sneezing dramatically

Interactive Prompt:  
"Would your pup like this kid? Boo!"

#### Pages 18-19: Phone Lady Ignoring

(Left 18)

Next came a woman glued to her screen,
Scrolling where no dog had been.
"Just need one for my #DogLife posts,
Maybe in a sweater with matching toast?"

(Right 19)

Toby dropped his ball at her feet,
"Oops! My latte!" came her bleat.
He sighed and turned - this wasn't right,
A human should SEE their pup's delight.

- Spilled coffee cup, ball rolling away

Interactive Prompt:  
"Put down your phone and pet your pup!"

#### Pages 20-21: The Girl Who Knew His Name

(Left 20)

Then - a whisper soft and true:
"I'd name him Toby...if I could choose."
Toby's ears shot up, his heart went BOOM,
Someone knew his name in that room!

(Right 21)

He nudged her leg, tail THUMP-THUMP-THUD,
Dropped his ball in a puddle of mud.
She knelt down, tears in her eyes,
"You...you picked ME?" Toby sighed, "Wise."

Illustration:
- Shy girl crouching to Toby's level
- Muddy ball between them

Interactive Prompt:  
"Ask your pup: 'Would you choose me too?'"

#### Pages 22-23: New Beginning

(Left 22)

Leash clipped on - not tight, just right,
Walking home through city light.
Finley waved from a fire escape,
Cheezy stole snacks - his usual shape.

(Right 23)

Toby knew he'd miss the street,
The wild adventures, scraps to eat.
But as his girl whispered, "Goodnight, **new** friend,"
He found his perfect story's end.

Illustration:
- Girl walking Toby past city sights
- Finley and Cheezy waving goodbye

Interactive Prompt:  
"Give your pup a goodnight kissd!"
